## Education
I began my formal education in 2011 when I was admitted to Programmer School in class Nursery. This foundation laid the groundwork for my academic development and sparked my interest in technology and programming. I progressed through the school, culminating in my completion of matriculation in March 2024. For ninth and tenth grade, I studied at MAK Collegiate (Up More Campus), where I further honed my academic skills and deepened my interest in various subjects. In addition to my school education, I have been enhancing my knowledge and skills by studying at the Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) since July 2023. At PIAIC, I am focused on Generative Applied Engineering, which is helping me deepen my understanding of AI and related technologies.<br/>
